// Executes a query descriptor against a trusted READ CALLABLE instead of Firestore. The

// `readVia: "CALLABLE"` (opportunity, salesOrder — functions/src/opportunity/
// opportunityReadService.ts, functions/src/salesOrder/salesOrderReadService.ts).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Those two collections are deny-all in Firestore Rules; a direct client
// `getDocs` against them denies every caller, permanently, even one holding the real
// `opportunity.read` / `salesOrder.read` capability. The entity already DECLARES that fact
// (`readVia: "CALLABLE"`, `readCallable: "listOpportunitiesForAccount"` /
// `"listSalesOrdersForAccount"`); this is the translator that honors it, the same way
// firestoreListSource.js honors `readVia: "CLIENT_DIRECT"`. The runtime decided everything
// already — the parent scope, the sort, the bound (buildQueryDescriptor, listRuntime.js) —
// and this adds nothing of its own except the one thing a callable needs that a Firestore
// query does not: which callable to call and how to unwrap its response envelope.
//
// SAME INVOCATION PATTERN AS THE EXISTING CLIENTS. httpsCallable + a lazy import of
// "firebase/functions" and "../firebase/firebase.js" (no import-time initializeApp side
// effect) is exactly services/accountOpportunitiesReadCallableClient.js's and
// services/accountSalesOrdersReadCallableClient.js's own `invoke`. This is not a second way
// to call the same function — it is the metadata list runtime's caller of that same
// pattern, because those two client modules are request-shaped for the hooks that already
// consume them (useAccountOpportunities.js / useAccountSalesOrders.js), not for a query
// descriptor.

// httpsCallable errors carry a `functions/`-prefixed code (e.g. "functions/permission-denied"),
// unlike a Firestore SDK error's bare "permission-denied". Stripped here — mirroring
// services/accountOpportunitiesReadCallableClient.js's own mapErrorToStatus — so a caller
// that already checks `err.code === "permission-denied"` (MetadataRecordPage.jsx's
// useRelatedListPresentation, matching firestoreListSource.js's own errors) sees the SAME
// code shape regardless of which source produced it. Doing this here, once, is what keeps
// that check from having to know two different error dialects.

// own entity-named list plus its own `skipped`/`truncated` bookkeeping — see
// AccountOpportunityListResult / AccountSalesOrderListResult in the read services). Adding
// a third CALLABLE-read entity means adding one line here, naming the response key that
// entity's read service actually returns — not inventing a shape the service does not have.

/**
 * Fetch one page through a descriptor's declared `readCallable`.
 *
 * Returns the SAME shape firestoreListSource.js's fetchPage returns — `{ rows, hasMore,
 * nextCursor, nextCursorDoc }` — so interpretPage's caller and buildListPresentation work
 * unchanged regardless of which source produced the page. `nextCursorDoc` is always null:
 * a callable page has no Firestore document to resume from, and today's only caller
 * (MetadataRecordPage's DefaultRelatedList) never requests a second page of a RELATED
 * section, matching the source's own "caps its rows and hands off instead" rule
 * (listPresentation.js).
 *
 * THROWS LOUDLY, NEVER FALLS THROUGH:
 *   - no `readCallable` on the descriptor, or a `readCallable` this module has no response
 *     mapping for — a misconfigured entity, not a live read to attempt;
 *   - no parent-scope filter on the descriptor — a RELATED descriptor with nothing to send
 *     as the callable's scope argument, which buildQueryDescriptor never produces but this
 *     function does not trust blindly;
 *   - the callable itself rejects — surfaced with a normalized `.code` so DENIED stays
 *     distinct from UNAVAILABLE exactly like a Firestore read failure does.
 * A caller choosing to fall back to a direct Firestore read on any of these is the exact
 * defect this module exists to close, so none of them degrade — they throw.
