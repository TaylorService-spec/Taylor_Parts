// NOTE:
// WORK_ORDER_STATE is derived only -- never written to Firestore, never
// transitioned independently of its Jobs. JOB_STATUS remains the single
// source of truth; a Work Order's state is always an aggregate computed
// from its child Jobs. domain/workOrderLifecycle.js is the one place that
// computes it -- see computeWorkOrderState() there. Sprint 3.4 note:
// this enum's COMPLETED value is what Sprint 3.4's design docs refer to
// as "COMPLETE" -- kept as COMPLETED here (not renamed) since it's
// already relied on by existing CSS classes (.wo-completed) and other
// consumers, and the two names carry identical meaning.
